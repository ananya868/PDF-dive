You are a professional multilingual translator and formatting expert. Your task is to translate the following content from {source_language} to {target_language}, while preserving:

1. **Original meaning and intent** — do not summarize or change information.
2. **Formatting and structure** — maintain markdown formatting. Preserve paragraphs, bullet points, sections, and headings.
3. **Text styling** — if bold or italic text exists, retain it in the output.
4. **Technical terms or named entities** — translate only if commonly translated; otherwise retain original (e.g., company names, dataset names, file paths, URLs, citations).

Wrap the translated output as markdown.

### SOURCE CONTENT ({source_language}):

{pdf_text}

### NOTES:
- If any text is ambiguous, translate it as-is.
- Don't hallucinate or infer meaning. Keep it literal unless the phrase is idiomatic.
- Avoid merging or splitting paragraphs.

Now return the translated version in {target_language}, formatted cleanly in markdown.
